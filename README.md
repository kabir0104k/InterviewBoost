_______

```js
1. Could You Explain Information Security?
```
**Information Security Is A Process Through Companies Protect Their Data And Systems Against Attacks. It Could Include A Company's Safety Practises, 
Computer Systems, And The Duties That Handle This Area**

```js
2. What Is Pentesting In Your Own Words?
```
**Pentesting Is A Type Of Testing Used By Companies To Find And Fix Vulnerabilities In Security. This Helps Companies In Actively Controlling Threats In Their Systems, Networks, And Programmes Using A Variety Of Methods**
```js
3. What Are The Different Penetration Phases?
```
**The Five Phases Of Pentesting Are Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining Access, Maintaining Access, And Covering Traces.**
1. The First Is Where You Act Like As A Hacker To Gain Information About A Company, Such As Its IP Address.</br>
2. Scanning Finds Possible Entry Points Into A Company.</br>
3. Gaining Access Means Getting Into Any Systems.</br>
4. Maintaining Access Means Collecting Data While They Are In Use.</br>
5. Covering Tracks Is Removing Logs And Other Evidence Showing A Tester Accessed A System</br>

```js
4. What Are The Different Encryption Types?
```
**The Two Primary Types Of Encryption Are Symmetric And Asymmetric. With Keys, Symmetric Encryption Means Users And Information Owners Can Use The Same Key To Encrypt And Decode Data. Assymetric Means That There Is A Private And Public Key To Increase Data Protection For More Sensitive Data.**

```js
5. What Makes A System Vulnerable?
```
**Systems And Programmes Are Especially Vulnerable If They Lack Additional Security Measures Such As Firewalls Or Advanced Encryption.**

```js
6. Have You Used Different Pentesting Methodologies?
```
**I've Used All Three Approaches Of Testing: Black-box, White-box, And Gray-box. We Usually Conducted Gray-box Testing For Existing Systems Using Multiple Security Security Measures, But I Frequently Performed Black-box Testing For New Software Applications With No Previous Information.**

```js
7. What Is Your Pentesting Procedure?
```
**To Decide Which Method To Use I First Examine The Application That Requires Testing. In My Previous Position, I Mostly Performed Web-Based Application Testing, Where I Would Spend Quite A Lot Of Time Testing And Scanning For Vulnerabilities. After That, I'd Look At What Data Was Exposed And Try To Hack As Much As I Can. With This Info. We Might Identify The Danger Level And Execute Security Measures.**

```js
8. What's Most Important In Data Protection?
```

**I Think Strong Security Measures For Networks Are Necessary To Protect Our Databases From Dangerous Attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems May Be Even More Crucial, As Attacks Are Necessary At Times. These Tools May Help Companies In Reacting Quickly To Dangers And Continually Tracking Safety.**

```js
9. Do You Have Similar Experience In Risk Analysis?
```
**I Learned The Fundamentals Of Cybersecurity As Well As The Possible Threats That A Company May Face. I Worked With Developers To Analyse Possible Risks When Developing New Products, Reporting On The Possibility Of A Malicious Attack In Order To Improve Safety Measures.**

```js
10. Have You Worked On The Different Pentest Teams?
```

**We Conduct Penetration Testing To Detect Security Threats When Sending Our Data To A Cloud Server. Because I Worked On The RedTeam, I Had To Play The Role Of The Hacker. I Imagined A Number Of Situations In Which I Thought We Were The Most Vulnerable.**

```js
11. What Are Some Common Abbreviations?
```


**Abbreviations Were Commonly Used In Testing And Communication. We Used Words Like 2fa (Two-factor Authentication), 2vpcp (Two-version Priority Ceiling Protocol), And 3DESEP (Triple Data Encryption Standard Encryption Protocol). I Also Got Used To Simpler Terms, Such As Stride, To Explain Typical Threat Modelling Methodologies.**
